HW PROBE 1.3
============

NAME:
  Hardware Probe Tool (HW Probe) — a tool to probe for hardware, check its operability and upload result to the Linux hardware DB: https://linux-hardware.org
  
  You'll get an URL to view the probe of the computer. Probe — is a snapshot of your computer's hardware state and system logs.
  
  Sample probe: https://linux-hardware.org/index.php?probe=b394035f90
  
  Share your probes and logs with Linux developers in order to debug and fix problems on your computer. Simplify inventory of hardware and navigate over the computers in your company.
  
  You can make a probe with the help of a script, Linux ISO or Docker (see below).

INSTALL:
  sudo make install prefix=/usr
 
DEB PACKAGE BUILDING:
Build and install the latest version of hw-probe as a deb (Debian/Ubuntu) package:

  sudo apt install devscript equivs
  git clone https://github.com/linuxhw/hw-probe.git
  cd hw-probe
  # Make sure that the latest version is in debian/changelog, if not — add it manually and save changes, otherwise you will build and install the latest version of hw-probe, but the DEB package will be marked as an older version.
  xdg-open debian/changelog
  sudo mk-build-deps --install debian/control
  debuild -i -us -uc
  sudo apt install ../hw-probe_*.deb

DEB REPOSITORY:
Install hw-probe from third-party deb repository for Ubuntu and Debian (tested on Ubuntu >= 16.04):

  wget -q -O- http://repo.dumalogiya.ru/keys/mikhailnov_pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
  sudo wget http://repo.dumalogiya.ru/dumalogiya-xenial.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dumalogiya-xenial.list
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install hw-probe
  
USAGE:
  su
  hw-probe -all -upload -id PC_NAME

  Run as root, PC_NAME — any description of the probe.
  
  On Ubuntu, the root password (needed for su) is set as a random one, to use 'su' on Ubuntu, first set the root password:
  sudo passwd

LIVE ISO:
  If the tool is not pre-installed in your system or you have troubles with installing the tool or its dependencies (e.g. hwinfo is not available in the repository) then try this Linux ISO with hw-probe installed: https://mirror.yandex.ru/rosa/rosa2016.1/iso/ROSA.Fresh.R9/
  
  Boot this Linux ISO in Live mode on your computer and make a probe (see USAGE).
  
DOCKER:
  You can easily make a probe on any Linux distribution without installing the tool with the help of the Docker image:
  
    sudo docker pull linuxhw/hw-probe
    sudo docker run -it -v /dev:/dev:ro -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro -v /etc/os-release:/etc/os-release:ro -v /var/log:/var/log:ro --privileged --net=host --pid=host linuxhw/hw-probe -all -upload -id PC_NAME
     
  You may need to run 'xhost +local:' before docker run to collect X11 info (xrandr, xinput, etc.).

REQUIRES:
  Perl 5
  hwinfo (https://github.com/openSUSE/hwinfo or
          https://linux-hardware.org/downloads/hwinfo/)
  curl
  dmidecode
  pciutils (lspci)
  usbutils (lsusb)
  smartmontools (smartctl)

SUGGESTS:
  systemd-tools (systemd-analyze)
  hdparm
  sysstat (iostat)
  memtester
  ...
  
  See full list of suggested packages in the INSTALL file.

GROUP COMPUTERS (INVENTORY):
  hw-probe -get-group
  hw-probe -all -upload -id PC_NAME -group ID

YOUR COLLECTION:
  Create your collection of probes for offline use:
  
  sudo hw-probe -import DIR
