HW PROBE 1.3
============

NAME:
  Hardware Probe Tool (HW Probe) — a tool to probe for hardware, check its operability and upload result to the Linux hardware DB: https://linux-hardware.org
  
  You'll get an URL to view the probe of the computer. Probe — is a snapshot of your computer's hardware state and system logs.
  
  Sample probe: https://linux-hardware.org/index.php?probe=b394035f90
  
  Share your probes and logs with Linux developers in order to debug and fix problems on your computer. Simplify inventory of hardware and navigate over the computers in your company.
  
  You can make a probe with the help of a script, Linux ISO or Docker (see below).

INSTALL:
  sudo make install prefix=/usr
  
  On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint you can create and install Deb package by:
  
  sudo apt-get install build-essential
  dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -tc
  sudo apt-get install ../hw_probe_*.deb
  
  If you don't want to install anything to your system, then you can probe your computer by Docker image or Live ISO (see below).

USAGE:
  sudo hw-probe -all -upload -id DESC

  DESC — any description of the probe.

LIVE ISO:
  If the tool is not pre-installed in your system or you have troubles with installing the tool or its dependencies (e.g. hwinfo is not available in the repository) then try this Linux ISO with hw-probe installed: https://mirror.yandex.ru/rosa/rosa2016.1/iso/ROSA.Fresh.R10/
  
  Boot this Linux ISO in Live mode on your computer and make a probe (see USAGE).
  
DOCKER:
  You can easily make a probe on any Linux distribution without installing the tool with the help of the Docker image:
  
    sudo docker run -it -v /dev:/dev:ro -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro -v /etc/os-release:/etc/os-release:ro -v /var/log:/var/log:ro --privileged --net=host --pid=host linuxhw/hw-probe -all -upload -id DESC
     
  You may need to run 'xhost +local:' before docker run to collect X11 info (xrandr, xinput, etc.).

REQUIRES:
  Perl 5
  hwinfo (https://github.com/openSUSE/hwinfo or
          https://linux-hardware.org/downloads/hwinfo/)
  curl
  dmidecode
  pciutils (lspci)
  usbutils (lsusb)
  smartmontools (smartctl)

SUGGESTS:
  systemd-tools (systemd-analyze)
  hdparm
  sysstat (iostat)
  memtester
  ...
  
  See full list of suggested packages in the INSTALL file.

GROUP COMPUTERS (INVENTORY):
  hw-probe -get-group
  sudo hw-probe -all -upload -id DESC -group ID

YOUR COLLECTION:
  Create your collection of probes for offline use:
  
  sudo hw-probe -import DIR
