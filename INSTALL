2.1 Remove

     sudo make uninstall prefix=PREFIX



3. UBUNTU PPA
=============

    On Debian, Ubuntu, Mint and other Debian-based Linux distributions you can install a PPA package.
    See https://launchpad.net/~mikhailnov/+archive/ubuntu/hw-probe for more info.

3.1 Install

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mikhailnov/hw-probe
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install hw-probe



4. DEBIAN PACKAGE
=================

   Build and install the latest version of hw-probe as a Deb (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint) package:
   
4.1 Quick way

     sudo apt install build-essential
     dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -tc
     sudo apt install ../hw-probe_*.deb

4.2 Neat way

     # Install build scripts
     sudo apt install devscripts
     
     # You may want to manually update the version of hw-probe in debian/changelog, just edit it in any text editor and save
     # Install build dependencies as a dummy package hw-probe-build-deps, which will denpend from other build dependencies
     sudo mk-build-deps -r --install debian/control
     
     # Now build the package
     dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -tc -i
     
     # And install it (note, that it will be located one directory level up than the current directory)
     sudo apt install ../hw-probe_*.deb
     
     # Remove build scripts and build dependencies
     sudo apt autoremove hw-probe-build-deps devscripts

4.3 Uninstall

    # Remove hw-probe and dependencies
    sudo apt autoremove hw-probe



5. USAGE
========

   Make a probe and upload result to the DB (DESC â€” any description of the probe):

     sudo hw-probe -all -upload -id DESC



6. LIVE ISO
===========

   The Live ISO with hw-probe installed: https://mirror.yandex.ru/rosa/rosa2016.1/iso/ROSA.Fresh.R10/
   
   Boot this Linux ISO in Live mode on your computer and make a probe (see USAGE).



7. DOCKER
=========

   You can easily make a probe on any Linux distribution
   without installing the tool with the help of the Docker image:
   
     sudo docker pull linuxhw/hw-probe
     sudo docker run -it -v /dev:/dev:ro -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro -v /etc/os-release:/etc/os-release:ro -v /var/log:/var/log:ro --privileged --net=host --pid=host linuxhw/hw-probe -all -upload -id DESC
     
   You may need to run 'xhost +local:' before docker run to collect X11 info (xrandr, xinput, etc.).



8. PRIVACY
==========

   Private information (including the username, machine's hostname, IP addresses,
   MAC addresses and serial numbers) is NOT uploaded to the database.
   
   The tool uploads SHA512 hash of MAC addresses and serial numbers to properly
   identify unique computers and hard drives. All the data is uploaded securely
   via HTTPS.



Enjoy!
